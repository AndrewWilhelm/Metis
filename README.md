# Metis
A program to test various artificial intelligence implementations. Robots are dispatched to distribute packages from a central distribution point to target locations as efficiently as possible. Robots cannot run into one another and can only move at certain speeds.

# Running the Program:
To run the program, use the command "python gridDraw.py"

# Visual Representation:
The robots are colored as blue circles. A robot with a package has its inner status light colored yellow. A robot without a package has its inner status light colored red. The distribution center is represented as a red square. Target locations (a.k.a "holes") for package drop-off is represented by blue squares.
